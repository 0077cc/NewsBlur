    <p style="font-size: 37px; color:#555555; margin-top: 18px;margin-bottom: 10px;padding-top:6px;">Welcome to NewsBlur, {{ user.username }}.</p>
    <p style="line-height: 20px;">OK, firstly, thank you for trying out new software. It's not quite what you're used to, but you might find NewsBlur to be a perfect fit. There's a lot packed into a minimal interface.</p>
    <p style="line-height: 20px;">Spend a few days trying out NewsBlur. I hope you end up loving it.</p>
    <p style="line-height: 20px;">If you really do love using NewsBlur you can purchase a fancy new <b>premium account</b> for only $1/month. You get to support an independent developer, help feed his dog, and contribute to the long-term health of NewsBlur.</p>
    <p style="line-height: 20px;">(Plus, among other cool premium-only features, all of your sites will update more often. Going premium supports 100% genuine hard-work and you'll make me a very happy developer.)</p>
