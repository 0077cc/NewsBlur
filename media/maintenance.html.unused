<h1>NewsBlur is upgrading...</h1>

<p>Upgrading PostgreSQL. It's Friday night (really, Saturday morning) at 12:20am. No more than 30 minutes. As little as 5 minutes.</p>

<p><b>UPDATE 12:57am</b>: OK, I lied. Turns out it took 30 minutes just to get the upgrade *started*. If you've ever upgraded postgresql, you know what a pain in the butt this can be. But it's going and now I'm just writing up maintenance posts for only a few dozen people to see. Go bother <a href="http://twitter.com/samuelclay">@samuelclay</a> for the next 10-15 minutes. :-)</p>
